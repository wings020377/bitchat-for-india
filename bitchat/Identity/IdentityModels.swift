/// # IdentityModels
///
/// Defines BitChat's innovative three-layer identity model that balances
/// privacy, security, and usability in a decentralized mesh network.
///
/// ## Overview
/// BitChat's identity system separates concerns across three distinct layers:
/// 1. **Ephemeral Identity**: Short-lived, rotatable peer IDs for privacy
/// 2. **Cryptographic Identity**: Long-term Noise static keys for security
/// 3. **Social Identity**: User-assigned names and trust relationships
///
/// This separation allows users to maintain stable cryptographic identities
/// while frequently rotating their network identifiers for privacy.
///
/// ## Three-Layer Architecture
///
/// ### Layer 1: Ephemeral Identity
/// - Random 8-byte peer IDs that rotate periodically
/// - Provides network-level privacy and prevents tracking
/// - Changes don't affect cryptographic relationships
/// - Includes handshake state tracking
///
/// ### Layer 2: Cryptographic Identity
/// - Based on Noise Protocol static key pairs
/// - Fingerprint derived from SHA256 of public key
/// - Enables end-to-end encryption and authentication
/// - Persists across peer ID rotations
///
/// ### Layer 3: Social Identity
/// - User-assigned names (petnames) for contacts
/// - Trust levels from unknown to verified
/// - Favorite/blocked status
/// - Personal notes and metadata
///
/// ## Privacy Design
/// The model is designed with privacy-first principles:
/// - No mandatory persistent storage
/// - Optional identity caching with user consent
/// - Ephemeral IDs prevent long-term tracking
/// - Social mappings stored locally only
///
/// ## Trust Model
/// Four levels of trust:
/// 1. **Unknown**: New or unverified peers
/// 2. **Casual**: Basic interaction history
/// 3. **Trusted**: User has explicitly trusted
/// 4. **Verified**: Cryptographic verification completed
///
/// ## Identity Resolution
/// When a peer rotates their ephemeral ID:
/// 1. Cryptographic handshake reveals their fingerprint
/// 2. System looks up social identity by fingerprint
/// 3. UI seamlessly maintains user relationships
/// 4. Historical messages remain properly attributed
///
/// ## Conflict Resolution
/// Handles edge cases like:
/// - Multiple peers claiming same nickname
/// - Nickname changes and conflicts
/// - Identity rotation during active chats
/// - Network partitions and rejoins
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// // When peer connects with new ID
/// let ephemeral = EphemeralIdentity(peerID: "abc123", ...)
/// // After handshake
/// let crypto = CryptographicIdentity(fingerprint: "sha256...", ...)
/// // User assigns name
/// let social = SocialIdentity(localPetname: "Alice", ...)
/// ```
///
